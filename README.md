This is a Python script that uses the Web VPython 3.2 library to create a visual representation of a star (Kepler-62) and its six orbiting planets. The script uses scaled values for the radii of the astronomical objects and assumes that the planets move in perfect circles (and with zero inclination angles) around the star.
